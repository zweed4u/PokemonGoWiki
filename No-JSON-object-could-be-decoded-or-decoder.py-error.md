This has been the most common error i have seen in help and general chat. 

If you see "No JSON object could be decoded" or you see "decoder.py" in the last part of the error, this means that there is something wrong with your JSON.

Copy the json in json files and copy it into http://jsonlint.com/  Then fix the error it gives you in your json.
